# ModernBlog — Minecraft-Inspired Blog (Scaffold)

This repository is a scaffold for a Minecraft-inspired, voxel-style blog. It includes a minimal Next.js + Tailwind setup and core pages to start development.

Quick start

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run dev server
npm run dev
```

Notes
- This is a starting scaffold. Next steps: install Tailwind, add CMS (Sanity recommended), and implement design tokens & voxel assets.
- See `prd.md` and `task.md` for project requirements and tasks.
